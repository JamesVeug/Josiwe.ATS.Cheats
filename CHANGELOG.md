Hey folks, thanks for your interest in this mod. Development has stalled and no further updates are forthcoming. Feel free to fork the mod and re-use the code, make any changes, or release it on your own github. Thanks for all the interest and here's hoping it will be of use to another developer. - Josiwe

Many new cheat powers added by user Kurdran - thank you so much! You should now consider this mod to be co-authored by both of us :)
